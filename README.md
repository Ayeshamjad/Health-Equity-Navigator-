# Health-Equity-Navigator-

## Project Overview
### Purpose
The **Health Equity Navigator** is a data-driven project aimed at identifying and addressing healthcare inequalities across different regions in the UK. By leveraging health data on key metrics such as avoidable mortality and life expectancy, the project provides insights to support policy changes and healthcare improvements.

### Research Questions
- What are the primary drivers of healthcare inequalities across different regions in the UK?
- How does avoidable mortality vary across socioeconomic and geographic lines in the UK?
- To what extent does health expectancy differ between urban and rural areas in the UK?
- How do specific healthcare interventions correlate with reductions in avoidable mortality?
- What trends in life expectancy indicate potential future challenges in healthcare equality across UK regions?
- What role does income inequality play in healthcare outcomes across different UK regions?
- How do healthcare inequalities impact the overall quality of life and productivity in affected communities?
- What actionable recommendations can be made to policymakers to address healthcare inequalities based on current data?
